                   (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/09/20


`plainpkg.tex' provides a "minimal" method for making "generic"
packages, combining `maybeload' functionality, fallback definitions 
for \ProvidesPackage and \RequirePackage, and handling of arbitrary 
(multiple) "private letters" in nested package files. The 
documentation contains a central reference for making and using 
"generic" packages based on `plainpkg.tex'.
