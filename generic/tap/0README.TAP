BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENTS

TAP.TEX: a TeX package for typesetting tables; it exploits some possibilities
         offered by PostScript. The idea of the package was taken from
         the package TABLES by Michael J. Ferguson, however, the package TAP
         was re-implemented from scratch.

TAPCV:   directory containing TAPCV.AWK (AWK program for translating tables
         written in extended ASCII format into TeX/TAP form) and
         a few samples.

TAPDOC:  directory containing files necessary for typesetting (TeXing)
         the documentation; moreover, there are two files, TAPXAMP1.TEX
         and TAPXAMP2.TEX, demonstrating a technique for constructing
         ``simple-but-complex'' tables.
