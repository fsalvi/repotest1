PSTricks offers excellent macros to insert more or less complex 
graphics into a document. pstricks.tex itself is the base for several 
other additional packages, which are mostly named pst-xxxx, 
like pst-rubans. 

Save the files

pst-rubans.sty 
pst-rubans.tex

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.

pst-rubans uses the extended version of the keyval package. So
be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pst-rubans, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex


If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-rubans-doc.tex
bibtex pst-rubans-doc
latex pst-rubans-doc.tex
dvips pst-rubans-doc.dvi

to get a PostScript file. But pay attention, that the pst-rubans
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code.

For another PDF output read the introduction from
the documentation.
