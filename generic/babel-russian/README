Russian Language Definition File for Babel v1.3a

Igor A. Kotelnikov <kia999 at mail dot ru>


1. INSTALLATION

- unpack russianb.zip     
- run latex.exe russianb.ins
- remove russianb.ldf that might come with babel;
  it is usually located at <textmf>/tex/generic/babel/contrib/russian.
- move russianb.ldf to the location indicated above.


2. USAGE

Russian language definition file can be used both with legacy 8-bit engines 
(such as latex.exe or pdflatex.exe) and unicode compilers (xelatex.exe or 
lualatex.exe). The unicode engines can be ran either in unicode mode or 
8-bit compatibility mode. The two modes differ by a set of packages loaded 
in the preamble of a source TeX file. It is important to keep recommended  
order of package loading, especially when running unicode engines 
in a compatibility 8-bit mode. 

In examples below, it is assumed that source file has utf8 input encoding.

2.1. 8-bit mode

2.1.1 PDFLATeX, LaTeX

    \usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.1.2 LuaLaTeX

    \usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[lutf8]{luainputenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.1.3 XeLaTeX

    \XeTeXinputencoding "bytes"
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.2 Unicode mode

    \usepackage{fontspec}
        \defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures={TeX}}
        \setmainfont{CMU Serif}
        \setsansfont{CMU Sans Serif}
        \setmonofont{CMU Typewriter Text}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

Instead of Computer Modern Unicode (CMU) font loaded in this example,
you may use any True Type or Open Type font installed on your computer.

2.3 Typesetting ancient book

    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}
    \languageattribute{russian}{ancient}
or
    \usepackage[english,russian.ancient]{babel}

Using unicode mode is strongly recommended for typesetting ancient texts. 
Be sure to take X2 or OT2 font encodings when running 8-bit engine such 
as latex or pdflatex. 


3. DOCUMENTATION

See russianb.pdf for more information.


4. KNOWN PROBLEMS

Before switching from a legacy 8-bit engine (tex, pdftex) to an unicode 
engine (xetex, luatex) and vise versa delete all .aux, .toc, .lot, .lof 
files as they might have stored incompatible internal encoding.

T2* font encodings do not have legacy cyrillic letter `yat', which is 
hard-coded in ancient caprion names. Be sure to use an unicode engine 
or take X2 font encoding when setting the language attribute to 
"ancient". Consult your font documention for other ancient glypths which 
might be absent.
