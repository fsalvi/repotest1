    For several years in the early nineties the late Michael Downes presented 
a series of TeX macro programming challenges he called Around the Bend. These
were archived on CTAN in info/aro-bend, but are now in info/challenges/aro-bend,
as 36 files called exercise.* and answer.*, but in general Around the Bend 
is not well known even though it illuminates some of the essential, but 
possibly more arcane, aspects of TeX. 

    I have been presumptuous and taken the liberty of putting them all into
a single document, AroundTheBend.pdf,  which might be more accessible than 
the individual postings that form the original archive. I have also included 
three challenges, namely 19, 20, and 21, that have not made it into the 
CTAN archive.

   If Michael was still with us I imagine that he would have put no 
restrictions on his work. With this in mind, the files comprising 
AroundTheBend.tex, which is the basis for AroundTheBend.pdf, are under 
the LPPL.
