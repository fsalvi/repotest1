             Adjust Language-Dependent Settings 
                     by Language Code

                 (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/09/20


`langcode.sty' in the first instance provides a command 

                   \uselangcode{<chars>}

to adjust language-dependent settings, such as key words, 
typographical conventions, and language codes (ISO-639-1).
An author frequently writing documents in two or more languages 
can use the same commands independently of the language, 
provided they are gathered in a list macro to be used by the 
`dowith' package. If `\<cmd>' is in the list, it is set to work 
like `\<chars><cmd>', and a macro `\langcode' will expand to 
<chars> (the respective tokens), usable in URLs. 

The package is ``generic," based on `plainpkg'. The code has 
been used with `morehype' and `catchdq' (`catcodes'), but may 
be useful more generally.
