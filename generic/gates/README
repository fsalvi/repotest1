Gates helps writing code in a modular fashion: macros are broken into
small chunks with names, which can be externally controlled and/or
augmented with new ones. Code thus written can be easily modified.

Gates is implemented independantly for both TeX and Lua; the former
requires the texapi package, while the latter can run with any Lua
interpreter (not just LuaTeX).

The files in this distribution are:

gates.tex     - TeX implementation
gates.sty     - wrapper for LaTeX
t-gates.tex   - wrapper for LaTeX
gates.lua     - Lua implementation
gates-doc.tex - master file for the doc
gates-doc.txt - text of the doc (readable in a text editor)
gates-doc.pdf - typeset doc

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
