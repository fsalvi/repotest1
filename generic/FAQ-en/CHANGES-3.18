Web interface:
  A mechanism is now in place, whereby old question labels may be used to get
  to the nearest current equivalent of the question.  It does not cover *all*
  old questions: please mail faq-devel@tex.ac.uk if you have a problem with an
  old question label that you have stored.

Bugfixes:
  Bits of silliness in the web interface continue to surface.  They get mended
  as soon as I work out how; the most recent was a tendency not to translate
  \textbackslash -- I know how to correct it, but not why it happened...
