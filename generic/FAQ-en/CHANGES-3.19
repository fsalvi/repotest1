Deleted answers:
 +Label outszwrng
(remember, as of the previous release, links to "old" labels remain
valid, pointing to an answer that is as near relevant as possible)

Web interface:
  The initial list of questions no longer gives a URL containing all
  the answers -- Google was returning that for every match, which
  didn't help!
  All links to CTAN files, directory .zips and directories for
  browsing are now http, and there's no longer any mention of .tar.gz
  archives of CTAN directories (since they're no longer available)
