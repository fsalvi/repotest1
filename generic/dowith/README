      Apply Command to Each Item in a List of Arguments 
               in TeX's Macro Expansion Buffer

`dowith.sty' provides macros for applying a command to all items
in a list of macro arguments, and also for extending and reducing 
macros storing such lists. "Brace groups" are single items of 
such lists, as opposed to token lists. Iteration is implemented 
within TeX's expansion processor, so works within \write as with 
`blog.sty'. Loop and list macros in other packages are discussed 
in the documentation. There is no need for e-TeX to which some
of them refer. 

`domore.sty' extends `dowith.sty' in order to apply multi-
parameter macros to a list and to insert "separator material" 
between resulting items. One application has been generating 
inline lists of links that are separated by ` | '.

The packages are "generic", i.e., should also work with Plain TeX, 
relying on the `plainpkg' package for some minimal LaTeX-like 
behaviour.
