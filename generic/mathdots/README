
This is the mathdots package, version 0.8.

This package changes the basic LaTeX and plain TeX commands \ddots and
\vdots so that they properly change size when font sizes change, and
when they are used in superscripts and subscripts. It also adds the
command \iddots ()for inverse diagonal dots) which slants the opposite
way from \ddots.

In addition, if it detects AMSLaTeX (or AMSTeX in plain TeX) it defines
improved versions of the \dddot and \ddddot commands that place three
and four dots on a math symbol (similar to the math accent commands \dot
and \ddot). These also are arranged to change size correctly and some
placement bugs are corrected.

Other (minor) improvements: the commands \vdots, \ddots and \iddots
select the dot from the math fonts instead of the text fonts, so they
always match math punctuation dots. The \dddot and \ddddot commands
select the accent dot (same one placed by \dot).
