                   (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/09/20

The `catcodes' bundle deals with category code switching. 
The contained packages should work with LaTeX as well as without 
(based on the `plainpkg' package). The important cases of category 
codes are 
(a) "private letters" for internal package commands and 
(b) active characters. 
`stacklet.sty' deals with (a), `actcodes.sty' with (b). 
There also is 
(c) `catchdq.sty', an application of (b), 
for automatic insertion of typographical double quotes 
when the user only enters ASCII double quotes. What is 
"typographical" differs between languages, the new `langcode' 
package completes `catchdq''s functionality in this respect.

The documentation for the three package files is contained 
in the file `catcodes.pdf'.

REQUIRED PACKAGES: plainpkg, stacklet
