This is the report

        The Components of TeX

It describes the components and files users of TeX get in contact
with.


To LaTeX the article five files are needed:

        etexkomp.tex    the real article
        figkomp.tex     a graphics with the relation of the components
        figtotal.tex    a graphics with all components and file types
        texrep.sty      the main style option, made for this article
        names.sty          is used by texrep.sty, definition of logos

Please note that texrep.sty redefines ^. If you incorporate this
report in an other document you should either typeset it in a group
or you should have a look at texrep.sty and change the macros/the
article.

Happy hours.
