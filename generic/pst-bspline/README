This package draws uniform, cubic B-spline curves, open and closed, based on a sequence of B-spline control points. There is also code which permits drawing the open or closed cubic B-spline curve interpolating a sequence of points. This update adds a number of macros allowing B-spline curves to be used as if they were parametric curves or graphs of functions,  including several macros for thickened B-splines.

The .tex and .sty files should be installed in a folder searched by TeX. All documentation is in pst-bspline-doc.pdf.
