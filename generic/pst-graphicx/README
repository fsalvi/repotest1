pst-graphicx allows the use of the LaTeX package graphicx
together with Plain TeX, e.g.

\input pst-graphicx% also loads the base pstricks.tex

\psframebox[shadow]{\includegraphics[width=5cm]{tiger}}
\bye

pst-graphicx does't load the package keyval, to prevent
a package mismatch with xkeyval, which is load by PSTricks.
