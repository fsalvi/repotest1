This is `rubibtex', a wrapper for `bibtex' which allows one to use
Russian letters as item names in bibliography with BIBTEX. It is part
of the T2 package.

It is assumed that your rusification is based on a T2 package (for
other rusifications this problem may be absent or may be solved
differently).

The discussed problem only arises when you are using Russian letters
as item names (i.e., in the argument of \bibitem command).  This could
generally be avoided: simply name the reference keys of your books
with Latin letters, --- these reference keys are purely internal LaTeX
values, and do not appear in the DVI file. There are no problems with
using Russian letters in book names, and in all other places which go
to the DVI file. But it _may_ be convenient to use Russian reference
keys in your BIBTEX database files.

You will need:

1) LaTeX setup based on a T2 package (in particular, the citehack.sty
   file which allows one to use Russian letters as references)

2) BIBTEX which does not have problems with 8-bit characters
   (otherwise it is impossible to use such BIBTEX in _any_ rusified TeX
   environment). Unfortunately, the default bibtex32.exe and bibtex.exe
   in a emTeX distribution appear to have problems with 8-bit characters.
   Try using BIBTEX binaries found at CTAN:biblio/bibtex/8-bit.

3) SED binary. It is available on any UNIX box. For DOS you can find
   it at

  ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/sed118b.zip

   Copy `sed.exe' to a directory contained in %PATH% environment
   variable.

4) The `rubibtex' script/batch file.

If reference names in your BIB database use russian letters, then run
`rubibtex' instead of `bibtex' (otherwise you can safely run bibtex).

If you are using DOS, copy `rubibtex.sed' to `\emtex\data' directory,
and copy `rubibtex.bat' to `\emtex\bin' directory.

If you are using UNIX, copy the `rubibtex' shell script to
e.g. `/usr/local/bin' directory.

Note: we assume a cp866 encoding (of BIBTEX database files) for DOS
and koi8-r for UNIX. Change the encoding of `rubibtex.sed' or
`rubibtex' script otherwise.
