The jTree package is an extension of PSTricks which is intended
to be used by linguists as a tool to typeset complex trees.  It
consists of 6 files: pst-jtree.tex, pst-jtree.sty,
pst-jtree-examples.tex, pst-jtree-doc.pdf, pst-jtree-doc-add.pdf
(which is essentially an appendix to the older
pst-jtree-doc.pdf), and a zip file containing the source code for
the documentation.
