TeX-EWD is a set of plain TeX macros that helps typesetting formulas,
calculational proofs, and programs written in Dijkstra's style. See
  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD13xx/EWD1300.html
for the `dot notation', i.e., the style for formulas and proofs, and the book
  Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming", Prentice Hall, 1976
for the `guarded commands language'.

The file dotnot.tex contains the (generic) macros and hints how to
use them, the files t1.tex and p0.tex demonstrate their usage.

The macros where testet using TeX-GPC.
