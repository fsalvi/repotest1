%% Package `pst-solides3d.tex'
%%
If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-solides3d-doc.tex
bibtex pst-solides3d-doc
latex pst-solides3d-doc.tex
dvips pst-solides3d-doc.dvi

to get a PostScript file. But pay attention, that the pst-solides3d
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code.

For another PDF output read the introduction from
the documentation.
