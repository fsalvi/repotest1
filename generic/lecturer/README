Lecturer creates slides for onscreen presentation
with PDF features. It works with plain TeX, LaTeX,
ConTeXt MkII and unfortunately not ConTeXt MkIV
(though it seems you can still produce handouts).

It requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX. If anybody wants to write
anything that makes it work with XeTeX, be my guest.
The problem comes from the lack of pdfTeX's primitives.

Relevant information can be found in lecturer-doc.pdf.
