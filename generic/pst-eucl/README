INSTALLATION
------------

   If you want to just test it quickly, keep the files:

	pst-eucl.pro, pst-eucl.tex and pst-eucl.sty

   in the directory where you work.

   For a good integration:

   copy pst-eucl.pro to your local texmf directory :

	/usr/local/texmf.local/dvips/pstricks (for example)

   	pst-eucl.tex and pst-eucl.sty to a directory referenced
        by the TEXCONFIG shell global variable, or in the local texmf
	directory :

	/usr/local/texmf.local/tex/generic/pstricks

   run `texhash`

   if you don't have a local texmf directory, you can create it or ask
   the root to create it by modifying the file:

	$(TEXMF)/web2c/texmf.cnf

	remove the original for the first line:
