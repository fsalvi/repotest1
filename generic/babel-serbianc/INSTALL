		Serbian cyrillic package for Babel

		Filip Brcic <brcha@users.sourceforge.net>

NOTE: These instructions are for incorporating serbianc directly into
      babel.  It is possible to use serbianc without doing this; see the
      README file.

1. HOW TO INSTALL

Download the Babel source package from CTAN <http://www.ctan.org> and unpack
it to directory <texmfbase>/tex/generic/babel.

Copy the serbianc.patch file, located in the source/generic/babel directory
into the directory where you unpacked the babel source.

Patch the Babel distribution using command
# cd <texmfbase>/tex/generic/babel
# patch -Np1 -i serbianc.patch

Build the Babel package using instructions from the Babel distribution.
1) edit language.dat to fit it for your purposes
2) # latex babel.ins
3) # initex bplain.tex (at the end type \dump when you get the * prompt)
4) # texhash
To build Babel documentation
5) # latex babel.drv
6) # makeindex -s bbind.ist babel
7) # makeindex -s bbind.ist -o babel.gls babel.glo
8) # latex babel.drv

2. HOW TO USE

When you use serbianc package, you have to set your keyboard layout to serbian,
and you have to use unicode-compliant text editor (such as kile under KDE). You
also have to save your file in utf-8 encoding.

Take a look at the sample cyrillic document that is included in this package.
