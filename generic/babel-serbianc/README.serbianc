1. HOW TO INSTALL

Just copy the files tex/generic/babel/serbianc.* into your <texmfdir>/tex/generic/babel
and rerun texhash.

Alternatively you can follow instructions provided in the file doc/generic/serbianc/INSTALL
which is oriented towards bundling serbianc with standard babel distribution.

2. HOW TO USE

When you use serbianc package, you have to set your keyboard layout to serbian cyrillic,
and you have to use unicode-compliant text editor (such as kile under KDE). You
also have to save your file in utf-8 encoding.

Take a look at the sample cyrillic document that is included in this package in the
directory doc/generic/serbianc. In short, all you have to do to use serbian cyrillic
support for latex is type

\usepackage[serbianc]{babel}

somewhere near the beginning of your master tex file.
