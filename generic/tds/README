This is the TeX Directory Structure (TDS) document, describing a runtime
layout of TeX-related files intended to be portable,
implementation-independent, etc.  Most TeX distributions have adopted
this in some form.

tds.tex is the master source file.  A few extra LaTeX packages that it
uses are in packages.zip, in the unlikely event that you don't already
have them.

http://tug.org/tds/ contains the current released version.  For older
versions, see ftp://tug.org/historic/docs/tds.  For the current
development sources, see http://tds.sarovar.org.

Happy installing.
